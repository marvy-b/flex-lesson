    As a little girl when asked what I wanted to become I playful say a computer engineer, little did I know I was speaking into the future. 
    I ended up studying Mathematics Education which wasn't the course I applied for but 'we muveee'- graduating with a second class lower, 
    I was concernced and wondering how I was going to get a good job considering the unemployment rate in Nigeria and most job applications I came across takes 2:1 as the least for employment, but once again we muveee.

    I was adviced to either take ICAN or transition into tech, and I chose tech. I knew it wasn't going to be easy, I mean I only did progarmming in my 2nd year of University and it was Q-basic (lol mostly the theorical part).
    Moving on, after I left camp I sent messages to more than 100 tech company for an internship role few responded saying "cause of the pandemic they can't employ me" and of course why would a company want to hire someone with no experience or prior knowledge to the work.

    My CV was blank the only skill I had on it was proficient with the use of Mircosoft tools(lol which I lied about then). 
    In the process of sending messages to companies, I met someone on LinkedIn who picked interest in me because of how passionate I was about learning, this good samaritain volunteenered to teach me so I had my first tech lesson with Damilola Seweje a Full-Stack Developer.
    I decided to apply for internship/entry role in other field aside tech because I needed money ofcourse and the experience too. I got a job in an Internet Providing Company as the Assistant Operation Intern(worked remotely sometimes). In the course of working with Miss Kemi Young(Head of Operations) I learnt alot.
    That was my first job in the corporate world and I'm forever grateful to God for it.(I can now say I'm proficient with the use of Mircosoft tools not 100% though still learning)

    In the course of serving my Fathers' land in IRU VI LG council in the SLG's office on Mondays/Thursdays and the LGI's office every Friday(very active), I enrolled in a course titled "Web Development Bootcamp" on Udemy.
    I am also a member of SheCodesAfrica and Zuri Training. I wasn't active on Zuri but I took SheCodesAfrica quite seriously.

    My journey in tech has not been an easy one but with God, determination and great passion,
    I will continue to strive until I become a pro and I will try as much as I can to keep you guys updated on how it's going. Cheers to success stories yet to come. One of my favorite quote that keeps me going.
    When I feel overwhelmed with learing/programming I try to remember that-
